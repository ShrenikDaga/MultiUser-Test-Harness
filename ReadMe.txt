General flow of the demo:
1. There are 2 client windows which have been started and each has its Comm(i.e the Transalator) listening on the port number specified in its commandline arguments. The sendfile path is TestLibraries.

2. I will be automatically sending a testRequest from one of the clients to the TestHarness, which mentiones the dll 'Requirements.dll' to be executed.

3. Thus this will cover both the parts of the demo, automated execution of the client UI window and automated test suite of the requirements.

4. I have added a sleep of about 8 seconds for you to read this file, after that all the execution will begin as mentioned.

5. Please close/minimize this popup window.
Thank you.
